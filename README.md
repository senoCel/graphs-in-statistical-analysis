Our files inside the Reproducible_Research_Group1_Assignment2 folder are composed of
- a CSV data with 4 datasets of x and y pairs
- a .ipynb file
- a summary of the sections of the paper we want to make reproducible (plus DOI to the original paper) as PDF

HOW TO RUN THE Datasetx,y-Graphs.ipynb file:

I used Pycharm on a Linux machine. On Windows, you can open the file with Visual Code Studio or Jupyter Notebook. For MacOS, Jupyter works as well.
Just open the Datasetx,y-Graphs.ipynb file with the programming environment. It can be run instantly, usually by clicking on a green arrow for "Run".

Graphs.ZIP file:

Here you can run our data with a Makefile.
There is a README.md inside it to guide you through the process on how to run it.
